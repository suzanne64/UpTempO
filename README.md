## Measuring the Upper layer Temperature of the Polar Oceans

UpTempO buoys are designed to measure ocean temperature in the euphotic (light-influenced) 
surface layer of the Polar Oceans. These relatively inexpensive ocean buoys are designed to 
be easily deployed in open water or sea ice â€“ covered conditions. As sea ice thins and retreats 
more and more each summer, the magnitude of ocean surface warming is accelerating. Our main goal 
is to measure this warming.

Data measured by drifting buoys that are part of UpTempO Buoy Project are available at 
http://psc.apl.washington.edu/UpTempO for download. Time series plots and track maps of the buoys
locations are also provided.
